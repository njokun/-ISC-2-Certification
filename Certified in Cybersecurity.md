 # (ISC)<sup>2</sup> Certified in Cybersecurity Certification

<br />Earlier in the year 2022, the International Information System Security Certification Consortium also known as (ISC)<sup>2</sup> launched a new certification that would help introduce aspiring cybersecurity professional to the indusrty called the (ISC)<sup>2</sup> Certified in Cybersuecurity or (ISC)<sup>2</sup> CC for short .
As of the time of this writing, the self-paced training and the certification exam are free of charge and I have long since completed the course and passed the exam. 
<br />Below you will find a link to a google docs file containing the notes I took down while studying for the certification exam.
